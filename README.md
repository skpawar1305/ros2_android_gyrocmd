# ros2-android-build

Build [rcljava](https://github.com/ros2-java/ros2_java) for android.  


## Versions & Envs

- NDK:  android-ndk-r23b
- ABI: arm64-v8a  
- Android API Level(minSdkVersion): android-24

## ROS2 java version  

[repo](./ros2_java_android.repos)  
This project uses galactic. However, due to some issues, subscriptions are not working with other galactic publishers. I recommend using humble nodes as a counterpart of the android's node.


## Steps to build

### 1. Build docker image
```
docker build -t ros2java-android-build ./
```

### 2. Build
```
python3 run.py ./out/soOut ./out/jarOut --srcDir ../src 
```
First and Second argument specifies where to copy build results.  
Eg. Specify `libs` and `jniLibs` dir of your Android project to copy `.jar` files and `.so` files.  

`--srcDir` option is using for adding packages other than ros2 java related packages, for example your own message package.  
You can just specify your `src` dir which contains multiple packages. This option is not mandatory.

Please build your android app by using Android Studio.

## skpawar1305:
I've changed the ROS_DOMAIN_ID to 112 in https://sourceforge.net/projects/maskor/files/ShiningDingo.apk

The complete source code of the app is in https://sourceforge.net/projects/maskor/files/ShiningDingo.7z, with generated ros2 dependencies. If you want to add your own custom messages, then you need to regenerate them using this repository. Else, you may directly add it to Android Studio and build the apk.
